<h2 id="label-Welcome+to+Rails">Welcome to <a href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a></h2>

<p><a href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> is a web-application and
persistence framework that includes everything needed to create
database-backed web-applications according to the Model-View-Control
pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also called the
presentation) into "dumb" templates that are primarily responsible for
inserting pre-built data in between <a
href="../../../classes/HTML.html">HTML</a> tags. The model contains the
"smart" domain objects (such as <a
href="../../../classes/Account.html">Account</a>, Product, <a
href="../../../classes/Person.html">Person</a>, <a
href="../../../classes/Post.html">Post</a>) that holds all the business
logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The controller
handles the incoming requests (such as Save New <a
href="../../../classes/Account.html">Account</a>, Update Product, Show <a
href="../../../classes/Post.html">Post</a>) by manipulating the model and
directing data to the view.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, the model is handled by
what’s called an object-relational mapping layer entitled Active Record.
This layer allows you to present the data from database rows as objects and
embellish these data objects with business logic methods. You can read more
about Active Record in <a
href="../../vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.">files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.</a></p>

<p>The controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both
layers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two
layers are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence.
This is unlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack
that is much more separate. Each of these packages can be used
independently outside of <a href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. 
You can read more about Action Pack in <a
href="../../vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.">files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.</a></p>

<h2 id="label-Getting+started">Getting started</h2>
<ol><li>
<p>At the command prompt, start a new rails application using the rails
command and your application name. Ex: rails myapp (If you’ve downloaded
rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Change directory into myapp and start the web server:
<code>script/server</code> (run with –help for options)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Go to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>/ and get “Welcome
aboard: You’re riding the <a href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>!”</p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the guidelines to start developing your application</p>
</li></ol>

<h2 id="label-Web+Servers">Web Servers</h2>

<p>By default, <a href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will try to use
Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise <a
href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will use the WEBrick, the
webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server, <a
href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will check if Mongrel exists,
then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures that you can
always get up and running quickly.</p>

<p>Mongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C-component (which requires
compilation) that is suitable for development and deployment of <a
href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> applications. If you have Ruby
Gems installed, getting up and running with mongrel is as easy as:
<code>gem install mongrel</code>. More info at: <a
href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org">mongrel.rubyforge.org</a></p>

<p>If Mongrel is not installed, <a
href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will look for lighttpd. It’s
considerably faster than Mongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production
use, but requires additional installation and currently only works well on
OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged to start with Mongrel). We
recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from <a
href="http://www.lighttpd.net.">www.lighttpd.net.</a></p>

<p>And finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, <a
href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will use the built-in Ruby web
server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for
development, but not for production.</p>

<p>But of course its also possible to run <a
href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> on any platform that supports
<a href="../../../classes/FCGI.html">FCGI</a>. Apache, LiteSpeed, IIS are
just a few. For more information on <a
href="../../../classes/FCGI.html">FCGI</a>, please visit: <a
href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI">wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI</a></p>

<h2 id="label-Debugging+Rails">Debugging <a href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a></h2>

<p>Sometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of
tools that will help you debug it and get it back on the rails.</p>

<p>First area to check is the application log files.  Have “tail -f” commands
running on the server.log and development.log. <a
href="../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will automatically display
debugging and runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also
be shown in the browser on requests from 127.0.0.1.</p>

<p>You can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your
code using the Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">WeblogController</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">ActionController</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Base</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">destroy</span>
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@weblog</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Weblog</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">find</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">id</span>])
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@weblog</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">destroy</span>
    <span class="ruby-identifier">logger</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">info</span>(<span class="ruby-node">&quot;#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!&quot;</span>)
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>The result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:</p>

<pre>Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1</pre>

<p>More information on how to use the logger is at <a
href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/">www.ruby-doc.org/core/</a></p>

<p>Also, Ruby documentation can be found at <a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">www.ruby-lang.org/</a> including:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: <a
href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/</a></p>
</li><li>
<p>Learn to Program: <a
href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">pine.fm/LearnToProgram/</a>  (a
beginners guide)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>These two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby
language and also on programming in general.</p>

<h2 id="label-Breakpoints">Breakpoints</h2>

<p><a href="../../../classes/Breakpoint.html">Breakpoint</a> support is
available through the script/breakpointer client. This means that you can
break out of execution at any point in the code, investigate and change the
model, AND then resume execution! Example:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">WeblogController</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">ActionController</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Base</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">index</span>
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@posts</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Post</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">find</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">all</span>)
    <span class="ruby-identifier">breakpoint</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;Breaking out from the list&quot;</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>So the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present
you with a IRB prompt in the breakpointer window. Here you can do things
like:</p>

<p>Executing breakpoint “Breaking out from the list” at …/webrick_server.rb:16
in ‘breakpoint’</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-ivar">@posts</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">inspect</span>
=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-node">&quot;[#&lt;Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;1\&quot;}&gt;,
     #&lt;Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Rails you know!\&quot;, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Only ten..\&quot;, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;2\&quot;}&gt;]&quot;</span>
<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-ivar">@posts</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">first</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">title</span> = <span class="ruby-string">&quot;hello from a breakpoint&quot;</span>
=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;hello from a breakpoint&quot;</span>
</pre>

<p>…and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually
work:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">f</span> = <span class="ruby-ivar">@posts</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">first</span>
=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-comment">#&lt;Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={&quot;title&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;body&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;id&quot;=&gt;&quot;1&quot;}&gt;</span>
<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">f</span>.
<span class="ruby-constant">Display</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">all</span> <span class="ruby-value">152</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">possibilities?</span> (<span class="ruby-identifier">y</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">or</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">n</span>)
</pre>

<p>Finally, when you’re ready to resume execution, you press CTRL-<a
href="../../../classes/D.html">D</a></p>

<h2 id="label-Console">Console</h2>

<p>You can interact with the domain model by starting the console through
<code>script/console</code>. Here you’ll have all parts of the application
configured, just like it is when the application is running. You can
inspect domain models, change values, and save to the database. Starting
the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.
Passing an argument will specify a different environment, like
<code>script/console production</code>.</p>

<p>To reload your controllers and models after launching the console run
<code>reload!</code></p>

<p>To reload your controllers and models after launching the console run
<code>reload!</code></p>

<h2 id="label-Description+of+contents">Description of contents</h2>

<p>app</p>

<pre>Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.</pre>

<p>app/controllers</p>

<pre>Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for
automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController
which itself descends from ActionController::Base.</pre>

<p>app/models</p>

<pre>Holds models that should be named like post.rb.
Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.</pre>

<p>app/views</p>

<pre>Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
weblogs/index.rhtml for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby
syntax.</pre>

<p>app/views/layouts</p>

<pre>Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common
header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the
&lt;tt&gt;layout :default&lt;/tt&gt; and create a file named default.rhtml. Inside default.rhtml,
call &lt;% yield %&gt; to render the view using this layout.</pre>

<p>app/helpers</p>

<pre>Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated
for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to
wrap functionality for your views into methods.</pre>

<p>config</p>

<pre>Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.</pre>

<p>components</p>

<pre>Self-contained mini-applications that can bundle together controllers, models, and views.</pre>

<p>db</p>

<pre>Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all
the sequence of Migrations for your schema.</pre>

<p>doc</p>

<pre>This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated
using &lt;tt&gt;rake doc:app&lt;/tt&gt;</pre>

<p>lib</p>

<pre>Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't
belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.</pre>

<p>public</p>

<pre>The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,
and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be
set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.</pre>

<p>script</p>

<pre>Helper scripts for automation and generation.</pre>

<p>test</p>

<pre>Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template
test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.</pre>

<p>vendor</p>

<pre>External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.
This directory is in the load path.</pre>
