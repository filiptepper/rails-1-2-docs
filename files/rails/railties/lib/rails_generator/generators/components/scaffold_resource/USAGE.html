<p>Description:</p>

<pre>The scaffold resource generator creates a model, a controller, and a set of templates that's ready to use as the
starting point for your REST-like, resource-oriented application. This basically means that it follows a set of
conventions to exploit the full set of HTTP verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) and is prepared for multi-client access
(like one view for HTML, one for an XML API, one for ATOM, etc). Everything comes with sample unit and functional
tests as well.

The generator takes the name of the model as its first argument. This model name is then pluralized to get the 
controller name. So &quot;scaffold_resource post&quot; will generate a Post model and a PostsController and will be intended
for URLs like /posts and /posts/45.

As additional parameters, the generator will take attribute pairs described by name and type. These attributes will
be used to prepopulate the migration to create the table for the model and to give you a set of templates for the
view. For example, &quot;scaffold_resource post title:string created_on:date body:text published:boolean&quot; will give
you a model with those four attributes, forms to create and edit those models from, and an index that'll list them 
all.

You don't have to think up all attributes up front, but it's a good idea of adding just the baseline of what's 
needed to start really working with the resource.

Once the generator has run, you'll need to add a declaration to your config/routes.rb file to hook up the rules
that'll point URLs to this new resource. If you create a resource like &quot;scaffold_resource post&quot;, you'll need to
add &quot;map.resources :posts&quot; (notice the plural form) in the routes file. Then your new resource is accessible from
/posts.</pre>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre>./script/generate scaffold_resource post # no attributes, view will be anemic
./script/generate scaffold_resource post title:string created_on:date body:text published:boolean
./script/generate scaffold_resource purchase order_id:integer created_at:datetime amount:decimal</pre>
